### Intro to the Document Object Model (DOM)
- The DOM is an object oriented depiction of the HTML and CSS in a web page.
- Every time a page is loaded its HTML and CSS are translated into a DOM.
- The DOM is actually what the browser uses to display the page.

#### What is an object?
- Objects are a way of describing the world into language a computer can understand.
- An object is a data structure that has both properties and methods.
  - Properties are data and can be a single value, an array, or another object.
    - In computer lingo these are analogous to variables.
  - Methods are actions that an object can perform.
    - In computer lingo these are analogous to a function.
- Objects can inherit the properties and methods of its parent object and overwrite them or add to them.

Example of an object:
Animal Object:
- Properties
  - Skin type
  - Movement type
  - Colour
  - Temperament
- Methods
  - Make a noise
  - Move
  - Eat

#### Inheriting from an object
Reptile Object - Inherit from animal
- Properties
  - Skin type: Scales
  - Movement Type: crawl
  - Colour
  - Temperament
- Methods
  - Make a noise []
  - Move [crawl]
  - Eat []
  - Grow scales []

Mammal Object - Inherit from animal
- Properties
  - Skin type: Hair
  - Movement Type [walk, hop, fly]
  - Colour
  - Temperament
- Methods
  - Make a noise[]
  - Move[if rabbit then hop, if bat then fly, else walk]
  - Eat[]
  - Grow hair []
  - Produce milk []

etc..

#### Abstraction and Instantiation
To instantiate an object to create an individual object from the object blueprint
- in computer lingo, the blueprint is known as 'class'

An 'abstract' class is one that can have its properties and methods inherited but can not be instantiated.
- If I say 'get me an animal' you will say 'what kind?'
- Defining an animal is useful as a blueprint that other things can inherit from but cannot be an actual thing
- Mammals inherit properties of animals and modify or add new ones. Reptiles do the same but in a different manner.
- Dogs and mice also inherit properties of mammals and add new ones, but you can go to the store and actually buy a dog or a mouse
- In computer lingo each individual dog is an instance of the dog class which inherits some properties from the mammal abstract class which inherits some properties from the animal class.
- Some properties can not actually be set until the object is instantiated. We know that dogs have a colour and temperament property but we don't know what colour or what temperament until we have an actual instance of the dog class.

- This object hierarchy is an intuitive way to describe the world and translate it into a language.

### Objects in computers
The concept of objects and object hierarchies is very common in computer software.
- If I right click on a graphic object in PowerPoint I can see and change its colour, transparency, size etc.
- Those properties are different if it's a line or a polygon or an image.

In GIS terms we can think of a feature as an instantiation of a feature class and the coordinates and attributes as its properties.
- The feature class can inherit different properties depending on whether it is a point, line, or polygon.
- When we display a layer on a map we can also set its display properties
  - size
  - colour
  - transparency etc..

### Going from HTML to the DOM
- The DOM is an object oriented depiction of the HTML and CSS in a web page
- Every time a page is loaded its HTML and CSS are translated into a DOM
- The DOM is actually what the browser uses to display the page

#### Important properties of HTML elements
- childElementCount
- children[5]
- innerHTML
- innerText
- id
- eventhandlers (onclick etc.)
- parentElement
- style
  - style.color='red'
  - style.dsiplay='none'
- tagname

#### Intro to Events
- Event Driven Programming
  - When Apple introduce the McIntosh in 1984 it introduced an entirely new paradigm into computer programming.
  - Prior to this, computer code was written and processed in a top down manner.
    - First line of code was executed, then second, etc.
- The McIntosh allowed the user to interact with the computer via the mouse
  - Click, double click, drag etc.. I.e. Events
- Event handlers are snippets of code that are executed in response to an event
  - Events also can occur when the mouse hovers over an object, when a window is resized, before and/or after a page is loaded, when the text in an input box is changed etc..
- Modern programming is largely object oriented and event driven
  - Programmers need to understand the events that occur in the environment that they are programming in and write event handlers for those events
  - They also need to understand the object model behind their environment so that they can manipulate those objects in response to events.

### Quiz: the DOM
Curly brackets indicate a block of code.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated, it serves as a blueprint and can be inherited from.
To instantiate an object means to create an individual object.
The style property of an HTML element contains an object of CSS properties.
Mouse events include Onclick.
