```<html lang="en">``` #this is a language attribute, saying that the page is in English
 
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8"> # does not have a closing tab, but has a character attribute
      <title>Document</title> # add title of your Webpage
    </head>
  
 ```<body>``` # inside the body section is the content of the webpage
 ```</body>```
 
```</html>```
