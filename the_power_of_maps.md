# The power of maps
Maps are more than diagrams that help you navigate from point A to point B. They are windows into information that allow us to explore our world, understand it better, and engage with it more productively. Maps can spark our curiosity, provide insight, spur us to action, and help us build solutions for a better world.

Maps are windows of information for exploration and discovery. They are interactive data repositories. They are a storytelling medium and a decision-making tool.

### Maps are data
Maps don't only provide a picture of what is on the ground - they can also be interactive repositories of data.
All of the maps have already been made. Our world is constantly changing, and we will never run out of things to map.

A dashboard combines maps and other data visualisations to monitor real-time operations.
Maps allow you to access information inside it, explore beyong what is currently visualised, and filter it to answer your unique questions. Maps provide a useful context for understanding large amounts of data.

### Maps tell stories
Maps don't only provide you with information - they also help you interpret it. Some maps guide your explanation to tell powerful and engaging stories. When maps tell stories, they turn information into knowledge and understanding.

Sound decisions require sound data. But this data must also be presented in a way that makes sense. Maps offer intuitive visualisations that can communicate many stories more effectively than words and pictures alone. When maps tell stories, they become powerufl tools to both educate and persuade.

### Maps can trigger emotional responses
Maps don't only convey information and knowledge. They can also make you feel.
Maps aren't just things thhat we read and consume. They are things that we contribute to and create. Maps offer us a way to engage with our communities, be they local, national, or global. We can use maps to share our own stories and to connect with one another.

### Maps provide innovative solutions
Maps don't only identify and communicate problems - they also help solve them. We can use maps to perform analysis and help improve our communities, prepare for emergencies, and plan for the future.

Every day, maps are created to help make decisions about everything from where to construct levies to how to limit the environmental impacts of new construction projects.
Maps aren't just for show and tell. They are powerful tools that we can use to analyse our world and make the important decisions that will shape it.

**Conclusion**
Maps offer us a way to explore our world. They can be intuitive tools for visualising and manipulating data. They can turn that data into stories to educate and persuade. They can move us and they can inform our decisions.
